Following requirements are common for both fixed length and dynamic length strings.
[PRS_SOMEIP_00372] Different Unicode encoding shall be supported including
UTF-8, UTF-16BE and UTF-16LE.c(RS_SOMEIP_00038)
[PRS_SOMEIP_00948] UTF-8 strings shall be zero terminated with a "\0" character.
This means they shall end with a 0x00 Byte.c(RS_SOMEIP_00038)
[PRS_SOMEIP_00084] UTF-16LE and UTF-16BE strings shall be zero terminated
with a "\0" character. This means they shall end with (at least) two 0x00 Bytes.c(RS_-
SOMEIP_00038)
[PRS_SOMEIP_00085] UTF-16LE and UTF-16BE strings shall have an even length.c
(RS_SOMEIP_00038)
[PRS_SOMEIP_00086] UTF-16LE and UTF-16BE strings having an odd length the
last byte shall be ignored.c(RS_SOMEIP_00038)
[PRS_SOMEIP_00087] All strings shall always start with a Byte Order Mark (BOM)
in the first three (UTF-8) or two (UTF-16) bytes of the to be serialized array containing
the string. The BOM shall be included in fixed-length-strings as well as dynamic-length
strings. BOM allows the possibility to detect the used encoding.c(RS_SOMEIP_00038)
